# Solution overview and structure

The solution files are included in `./src` and include 3 folders:

1. `src/enums` Where all enums are stored
2. `src/implementations` Where all required implementations are stored
3. `src/implementations` Where all pre-given interfaces are stored + an extra interface `VwapParts.interface.ts` created by me

# Quick side mention about the broken tests

I have written some unit tests for the calculator implementation (located in calculator.spec.ts), but unfortunately they cannot be run right now due to config issues.

# Notes/ assumptions

I have made all notes/ assumptions in the code comments.
